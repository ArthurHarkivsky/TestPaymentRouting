## Routing Logic Structure

I did not use deeper knowledge of payments, etc. here due to the time limit in your PDF-file.
This was done in 3 hours with pauses on personal activities.
The routing logic is structured with a clear separation of concerns and implementation flexibility:

### Architecture
- **Strategy Pattern**: Implemented in `MainProviderRoutingService` to make routing decisions based on configurable criteria
- **Interface-based Design**: `ProviderRoutingService` interface defines the contract, allowing multiple implementations
- **Provider Registry**: Dynamic provider registration through Spring's dependency injection

### Routing Rules
The routing logic follows a hierarchical decision tree:
1. Card BIN-based routing (primary criterion)
   - Visa cards (4xxx) → Provider A
   - Mastercard (5xxx) → Provider B
2. Amount-based routing (secondary criterion)
   - USD transactions over $1000 → Provider B
   - Non-USD high-value transactions → Provider A
3. Default fallback to Provider A

This structure was chosen because:
- It's **maintainable**: Rules are clearly separated and easily modified
- It's **testable**: Parameterized tests can validate each routing rule
- It's **extensible**: New routing criteria or providers can be added without changing existing code
- It follows the **Open/Closed principle**: Open for extension, closed for modification

## Handling API Failures

The system gracefully handles provider failures through multiple resilience patterns:

### 1. Retry Mechanism
- Uses Spring Retry with exponential backoff
- Configurable retry attempts and intervals in application properties
- Preserves transaction state between retries

### 2. Circuit Breaker Pattern
- Prevents cascade failures when providers are down
- Automatically stops routing to failing providers
- Trips open after a configurable failure threshold
- Attempts recovery after a cool-down period

### 3. Outbox Pattern for Reliable Event Processing
- Ensures events are never lost during provider communication
- Events stored in a database before processing
- Distributed lock prevents duplicate event handling
- Failed events handled according to retry policy

## API Documentation

The API is documented using OpenAPI (Swagger).

## Testing Approach

The testing strategy focuses on critical system parts and potential failure points:

### What Was Tested

1. **Unit Testing**
   - Core routing logic with parameterized tests (`ProviderRoutingServiceTest`)
   - Verification of each routing rule independently

2. **Integration Testing**
   - End-to-end payment processing flow (`PaymentIntegrationTest`)
   - API calls, database operations, and provider interactions
   - Provider failure and recovery scenarios using WireMock

3. **Performance Testing**
   - Load testing at different throughput levels (1, 10, 100 req/s)
   - Measurement of latency and success rates under load
   - Verification of system stability under stress

### What Was Skipped

1. **Simple Data Mappers**
   - Low-risk code with minimal logic
   - Covered indirectly through integration tests

2. **Standard Framework Components**
   - Spring Boot auto-configurations
   - Well-tested library code

3. **Basic CRUD Operations**
   - Standard repository methods
   - Validated through integration tests

This approach maximizes test coverage on business-critical parts while maintaining development efficiency.

## Used AI Enhancements

With all due respect, but I want to leave that for the next stage of the interview.

## Scaling for 10x-100x Traffic

To scale the system for dramatically increased traffic:

1. **Horizontal Scaling**
   - Containerize with Kubernetes for auto-scaling
   - Deploy across multiple availability zones
   - Implement stateless service design

2. **Data Layer Optimization**
   - Check queries plans and fix SQL/JPA code if required
   - Add indexes, fix or rebuild if needed 
   - Database sharding by customer segments
   - Time-based partitioning for historical data

3. **Performance Optimizations**
   - Implement caching layers for routing rules
   - Asynchronous processing for non-critical operations
   - Batch processing for analytics and reporting in the future

4. **Resilience Improvements**
   - Enhanced circuit breaking with partial degradation
   - Rate limiting to protect backends
   - Bulkheading to isolate system components

5. **Very high-load cases or too high resources consumption**
   - Consider checking a performance with the Micronaut framework
   - Tune JPA or consider using JDBC for some cases

6. **Hardcore high-load solutions for this service, it's part or for the other service**
   - Consider checking other JVM providers, garbage collectors, frameworks, DBs, languages
   - For extra hardcore try coding without frameworks and even functional programming
   
Smile and have a good day! :-)
